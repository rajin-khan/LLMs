GridGenius Forecasting Model:

- Model Type: Transformer-based deep learning model.
- Purpose: Predict daily maximum electricity demand based on climate and calendar features.
- Inputs:
    - Temperature (°C)
    - IsHoliday (binary)
    - Date (used to extract Year, Month, Season)
- Output:
    - Predicted Max Demand (MW)

Training Details:
- Trained on historical energy demand and climate data from Bangladesh (2018–2024).
- Data normalization and feature engineering applied pre-training.

Note:
- GridGenius itself does not predict directly.
- Forecasts are generated by the trained transformer model integrated into the backend, which can be accessed via the webpage
